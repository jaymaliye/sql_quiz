* All the problems below are being run from a psql session
 * that was launched from the following terminal session:
 * ```
 * $ cd; rm -rf quiz; mkdir quiz; cd quiz
 * $ git clone https://github.com/mikeizbicki/sql_quiz
 * $ cd sql_quiz
 * $ docker-compose build
 * $ docker-compose up -d
 * $ docker-compose exec pg psql
 * ```
 * 
 * You can run all practice problems at once with the command
 * ```
 * $ docker-compose < quiz_practice.sql exec -T pg psql -a
 * ```
 *
 * In the actual quiz, you will have only 2^2 problems to complete.
 * Each problem will be worth 2^1 points instead of 2^0 points,
 * so the quiz will overall be worth 2^3 points.
 * (Notice that I've switched to SQL math notation here instead of python.)
